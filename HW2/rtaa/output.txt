Starting RTAA* algorithm
================================================
Iteration 1: Current position = 1
CLOSED list: [1, 2, 3, 4]
OPEN:     [ 5   6]
OPEN f:   [ 5   5]
i:     [ 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10]
hi:    [ 5   4   3   2   3   4   3   2   1   0]
Moving to node 6, path segment: [6]
================================================
Iteration 2: Current position = 6
CLOSED list: [6, 5, 4, 7]
OPEN:     [ 1   2   3   8]
OPEN f:   [ 6   6   6   4]
i:     [ 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10]
hi:    [ 5   4   3   2   3   4   3   2   1   0]
Moving to node 8, path segment: [7, 8]
================================================
Iteration 3: Current position = 8
Goal reached Final path: [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
